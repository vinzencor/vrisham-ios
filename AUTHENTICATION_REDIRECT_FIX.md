# Authentication Redirect Issue - Debugging Guide

## 🚨 **Issue Description**

User successfully authenticates (logs show `user_919025412115`) but the app keeps showing the login page instead of redirecting to the main app.

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Firebase Auth Persistence**
- ✅ Added `browserLocalPersistence` to Firebase Auth config
- ✅ Authentication state should now persist across app restarts

### **2. Better Authentication State Logging**
- ✅ Added detailed logging to AuthContext
- ✅ Added logging to Firebase auth state changes
- ✅ Added logging to Login component redirect logic

### **3. Updated Login Redirect Logic**
- ✅ Simplified redirect condition to not require userData
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging logs

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Test Authentication Flow**
1. **Open Android app**
2. **Check Android Studio Logcat** for these logs:
   ```
   🔐 Firebase Auth persistence set to LOCAL
   🔄 Firebase Auth state changed: {...}
   🔄 AUTH CONTEXT: Firebase auth state changed {...}
   === AUTH CONTEXT: Authentication state === {...}
   === LOGIN: Checking authentication state === {...}
   ```

### **Step 2: Complete OTP Flow**
1. **Enter phone number**: `+918086221201` (or any working number)
2. **Request OTP**: Should work without "Failed to fetch" error
3. **Enter OTP**: Use the OTP from SMS
4. **Watch logs**: Should show authentication success

### **Step 3: Check Redirect Behavior**
After successful OTP verification, you should see:
```
=== LOGIN: User authenticated, redirecting to: /
```

## 🔍 **Debugging Information to Check**

### **In Android Studio Logcat, look for:**

#### **✅ Good Signs:**
```
🔐 Firebase Auth persistence set to LOCAL
🔄 Firebase Auth state changed: isAuthenticated: true
=== AUTH CONTEXT: Authentication state === isAuthenticated: true
=== LOGIN: User authenticated, redirecting to: /
```

#### **❌ Problem Signs:**
```
=== AUTH CONTEXT: Authentication state === isAuthenticated: false
=== LOGIN: Checking authentication state === isAuthenticated: false
```

## 🚀 **Expected Flow After Fix**

### **1. App Startup:**
```
🔐 Firebase Auth persistence set to LOCAL
🔄 AUTH CONTEXT: Firebase auth state changed hasUser: true
=== AUTH CONTEXT: Authentication state === isAuthenticated: true
```

### **2. Login Page (if user visits /login):**
```
=== LOGIN: Checking authentication state === isAuthenticated: true
=== LOGIN: User authenticated, redirecting to: /
```

### **3. Result:**
- ✅ User should be redirected to home page (`/`)
- ✅ No more login loop
- ✅ Authentication state persists across app restarts

## 🔧 **If Still Not Working**

### **Check These Logs:**

1. **Firebase Auth State:**
   - Look for `🔄 Firebase Auth state changed`
   - Should show `isAuthenticated: true` after login

2. **AuthContext State:**
   - Look for `=== AUTH CONTEXT: Authentication state ===`
   - Should show `isAuthenticated: true`

3. **Login Component:**
   - Look for `=== LOGIN: Checking authentication state ===`
   - Should show `isAuthenticated: true` and redirect

### **Common Issues:**

#### **Issue 1: Firebase Auth Not Persisting**
**Symptoms:** Auth state resets on app restart
**Solution:** Check if `🔐 Firebase Auth persistence set to LOCAL` appears in logs

#### **Issue 2: AuthContext Not Updating**
**Symptoms:** Firebase auth works but AuthContext shows `isAuthenticated: false`
**Solution:** Check if `🔄 AUTH CONTEXT: Firebase auth state changed` shows correct user

#### **Issue 3: Login Component Not Redirecting**
**Symptoms:** AuthContext shows authenticated but login page doesn't redirect
**Solution:** Check if `=== LOGIN: User authenticated, redirecting to: /` appears

## 📱 **Test Right Now**

1. **Run the updated Android app**
2. **Complete OTP authentication** with any working phone number
3. **Check if you're redirected** to the home page
4. **Close and reopen the app** - should stay logged in
5. **Check payment system** - should work without "not authenticated user" error

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

- ✅ **Login once** → Redirected to home page
- ✅ **Close/reopen app** → Still logged in (no login page)
- ✅ **Payment system** → Works without authentication errors
- ✅ **Cart persistence** → User cart data maintained

## 🔄 **If Problem Persists**

If the issue continues, the problem might be:

1. **Custom Token Expiration**: Firebase custom tokens expire after 1 hour
2. **Multiple Auth Systems**: Conflict between custom token auth and regular Firebase auth
3. **Route Protection Logic**: Issue with ProtectedRoute component

**Next debugging step:** Check if the issue is with custom token expiration by testing immediately after login vs. after waiting some time.

**The authentication persistence and redirect logic has been improved. Test the app now and check the logs to see if the redirect issue is resolved!** 🚀
