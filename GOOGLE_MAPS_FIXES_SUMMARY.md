# Google Maps Location Selection Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Search Functionality Broken ✅
**Problem**: Search input debouncing was not working correctly due to improper timeout handling in the callback.

**Fix**: 
- Separated search input handling from debouncing logic
- Used `useEffect` for proper debouncing instead of returning cleanup function from callback
- Fixed timeout cleanup to prevent memory leaks

**Files Modified**: `src/components/maps/GoogleMapPicker.tsx`

### 2. Map Dragging/Interaction Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Map interaction was limited due to restrictive gesture handling and missing interaction options.

**Fix**:
- Changed `gestureHandling` from default to `'greedy'` to allow all gestures
- Enabled `clickableIcons`, `keyboardShortcuts`, `scrollwheel`
- Set `disableDoubleClickZoom: false` for better user experience
- Ensured marker is properly draggable with `draggable: true`
- Added `animation: google.maps.Animation.DROP` for better visual feedback

**Files Modified**: `src/components/maps/GoogleMapPicker.tsx`

### 3. Location Picker Not Responsive ✅
**Problem**: Place selection from search results was overly complex and unreliable.

**Fix**:
- Simplified place selection mechanism
- Removed multiple timeout-based position corrections
- Used single `panTo()` call for smooth map navigation
- Improved error handling for invalid places
- Better state synchronization between search and map

**Files Modified**: `src/components/maps/GoogleMapPicker.tsx`

### 4. Default Location Issue ✅
**Problem**: Location detection and fallback mechanisms were not working properly.

**Fix**:
- Improved auto-location detection on component mount
- Added proper fallback to Chennai (business location) when GPS fails
- Enhanced location validation for India bounds
- Added reverse geocoding for both detected and default locations
- Fixed dependency issues in useEffect hooks

**Files Modified**: `src/components/maps/GoogleMapPicker.tsx`, `.env`

### 5. Environment Configuration ✅
**Problem**: Google Maps API key was not properly configured in environment variables.

**Fix**:
- Added `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` to `.env` file
- Ensured proper fallback in maps configuration

**Files Modified**: `.env`

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Fixed React hooks dependencies and warnings
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Simplified complex async operations

### Performance
- Proper debouncing for search input (300ms)
- Reduced unnecessary API calls
- Optimized map re-rendering with proper keys

### User Experience
- Smooth map animations with `panTo()`
- Better visual feedback with marker animations
- Improved search result selection
- Enhanced error messages

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Map Functionality
1. Open the application and navigate to address selection
2. Verify the map loads correctly (should show Chennai by default)
3. Click anywhere on the map - marker should move to clicked location
4. Drag the marker - it should move smoothly and update the address

### 2. Search Functionality
1. Type in the search box (e.g., "Bangalore")
2. Wait for search results to appear (should take ~300ms after stopping typing)
3. Click on a search result - map should navigate to that location
4. Verify the address is updated correctly

### 3. Current Location
1. Click the location button (navigation icon)
2. Allow location access when prompted
3. Map should navigate to your current location (if in India)
4. If outside India, should fallback to Chennai

### 4. Address Confirmation
1. Select any location using any method above
2. Verify the address appears in the "Selected Address" section
3. Click "Confirm Location" - should close modal and return location data

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/maps/GoogleMapPicker.tsx` - Main fixes for all functionality
2. `.env` - Added Google Maps API key
3. `test-maps.html` - Created test file for API validation

## API Key Configuration

The Google Maps API key `AIzaSyA6DZgq0n6pQ7UAtbQiuD6o1TJTx4b947s` is configured with:
- Maps JavaScript API
- Places API
- Geocoding API

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Known Limitations

1. Location detection requires HTTPS in production
2. Search is biased towards India (by design)
3. Some places outside India may be filtered out (by design)

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify internet connection
3. Ensure location permissions are granted
4. Try the test file (`test-maps.html`) to verify API functionality
